Talon Config
================

What is this?
--------------

[Talon Voice](https://talonvoice.com/) is a computer voice control engine that i.a. aims to bring _"full desktop computer proficiency to people who have limited or no use of their hands"_, developed by [lunixbochs](https://github.com/lunixbochs/).

To make use of it, you need to provide a configuration for the engine.
There are several ready-to-use configurations available, like [knausj_talon](https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon) for the beta version.

How to make use of the beta version of talon is documented in the [Talon community wiki](https://talon.wiki/).
This repository is the configuration that I'm using.

**You should not use this repository.**
**This is only my personal config.**
Use the community config instead.
Why?
Because:

_Permanent recording active._ Wav2Letter only. Only tested on linux. Non-standard vocabulary. Limited feature set.
Since the availability of the new generation of sconv models, allowances for accent/recognition issues are more and more removed.

Now the remaining reason for me to keep this is that I personally dislike too many of the command mappings of the community/knausj repo.
